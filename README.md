# Bitcoin-Trading-Bot
A Bitcoin Trading Bot based on reinforcement learning
Here in the code we have firstly made an environment which helps our agent to run and learn new steps. A agent is nothing but the model itself which will be going to predict or move according to the training given to it.
After that we have defined step, reset, and render where step is responsible for execution of step within the environment and reset function will reset the state of the environment to its initial state and the render function will render the environment visualisation.
further we will be creating a random_games agent.
we can instantiate CustomEnv environment with a data frame and test our Random_games agent.
Now we can have look at the episodes of the Random_games which will tell us about the average_net_worth and the net_worth by the help of which we can tell that our agent is in profit or our agent is in loss.
